Outline requirements:  
1. The description of each and every chapter. 
2. Subtopics of every chapter 
3. page count of every chapter.

Audience: This book is recuired the base knowledge of ReactJS

Request overview: The Next.js Cookbook contains React recipes optimized for performance, including hybrid rendering, route prefetching, automatic image optimization, and internationalization. The book covers comprehensive technical solutions for effectively utilizing Next.js in developing robust websites, blogs, forums, and web applications with an excellent user experience.

Each recipe ensures maximum performance and resource efficiency. Several of the recipes cover topics such as how to write unit and integration tests for an application, how to integrate different backends with the application, bundle and split code, and create API endpoints for improved server-side functionality. The advanced set of guidelines focuses on selecting the optimal rendering methodology, securing the site and app, deploying to multiple hosting providers, enjoying a live editing experience, delving into real-time insights about web pages, and adding auto language detection.
By the end of this Next.js cookbook, you'll have the solutions necessary to design, build, and deploy modern architectures with any headless CMS.

---

My general idea: The book should be created as a food reciepe book with illustrations and separation by several big blocks plus additioanal stuff as things for "dessert" (deploy to cloud services and using headless CMS)
